## Bringing autonomous robots and vehicles to educators
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
**The Minimum Viable Autonomous Vehicle** project is just starting! Please reach out to me at mrs175@case.edu if you are interested or have suggestions!

**Current progress:**
* [$50 autonomous car with code](github.com/sturzl/mvav)
* [Labs introducing autnomous vehicle technology](github.com/sturzl/mvavlabs)
&nbsp;

**Next Steps:**
* Better documentation
* Curriculum power up
  * Connect with educators to plan what curriculum to develop next
  * Integration with an existing [CS Curriculum](https://csunplugged.org/en/)
