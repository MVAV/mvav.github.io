## Bringing autonomous vehicles to students!

**The Minimum Viable Autonomous Vehicle** project is just starting! Please reach out to me at mrs175@case.edu if you are interested or have suggestions!

**Current progress:**
* [$50 autonomous car with code](https://github.com/sturzl/mvav)
* [Labs introducing autonomous vehicle technology](https://github.com/sturzl/mvavlabs)
* See the labs in action [here](https://twitter.com/MarcSturzl/status/1043548541698932737) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRSFsq6A5L4)!

**Next Steps:**

  * Connect with educators to plan what curriculum to develop next
  * Integration with an existing [CS Curriculum](https://csunplugged.org/en/)
